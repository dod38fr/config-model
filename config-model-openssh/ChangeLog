2012-05-16  Dominique Dumont <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.222

    * added AuthorizedKeysFile2 parameter (See Debian #671367) and migration
      from AuthorizedKeysFile2 to AuthorizedKeysFile to help migration
      from Debian Squeeze to Wheezy
    * replaced deprecated get_all_indexes with fetch_all_indexes
    * depends on Config::Model 2.015

2012-04-25  Dominique Dumont <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.221

	* Ssh model: ControlMaster also supports auto keyword (tx to
	  harleypig and Daniel Dehennin) Closes Debian #670319
	* Test: Fix skip count when test is run as root (fix smoke test
	  failures)

2012-02-20  Dominique Dumont <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.220

        * Fix test to force write back even if no data were changed in
          the test (Fix FTBS Debian #660371 and Ubuntu #935221)
        * This fix depends on Config::Model 2.004
        * Requires perl 5.10
        * Move runtime dependencies in configure-requires as config::model is
          called by Build.PL to (re)generate pod (see also RT73611)

2011-12-07  Dominique Dumont <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.219

	* Ssh model: do not warp LocalForward with GatewayPorts. 
	  They are independant
	* Ssh backend: store root config in layered data instead of 
	  preset data (also fix RT#72916) 
	* Depends on Config::Model 1.265

2011-07-22  Dominique Dumont <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.218

          when saving ssh config as a regular user. 

2011-05-11  Dominique Dumont <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.217

        * All Backend: test value with length instead of defined 
          (avoid keyword without value lines)
        * added Test::Difference build dependency
        * lib/Config/Model/user.d/ssh: added forgotten user file for ssh

2011-04-11  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.216

    * All: use Any::Moose instead of plain Moose
    * depends on Any::Moose (fix RT# 67307)
    
2011-04-04  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.215
    
        * All models: Added author, license and class_description
        * Added generated documentation from configuration classes.
        * Requires Config::Model 1.236

        * Fixed Build.PL to install files from lib/.../system.d/
        * Fixed Ssh backend to write Host pattern annotations/comments

2011-02-28  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.213

	* Fixed MANIFEST.SKIP to remove cruft shipped by Dist::Zilla. As
	  downstream packager, I was not amused :/

2011-02-23  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr> v 1.212

	  can be invoked with '-application ssh' or '-application sshd'
        * removed dependency on Parse::RecDescent
        * depend on Config::Model 1.234
        * Single backend was split in 3 (OpenSsh, Ssh and Sshd) to benefit
          from C::M::Backend::Any
           
2010-02-02  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com>

	* demo/demo.pl (my_system): new demo (requires Config::Model::Itself)

2010-01-24  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr>

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Ssh/PortForward.pl: host and hostport are mandatory

2010-01-22  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.210

	* lib/Config/Model/OpenSsh.pm: Modified to read and write Port
	forward information from PortForward config class.

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Ssh/PortForward.pl: New configuration
	class to make ssh port forwarding configuration easier.

2010-01-18  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.209

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Sshd.pl: Added automatic migration of
	data from deprecated KeepAlive parameter to TCPKeepAlive
	parameter. This enables an automatic migration from old sshd
	config to new syntax.

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Ssh/HostElement.pl: Since ssh_config doc
	mentions that LocalForward and RemoteForward can be specified
	several times, these 2 parameters are changed from leaf to a list
	of leaf.

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Ssh.pl: As specifying Host block as list
	of patterns and content was not practical, the Host element in Ssh
	model was changed from list of HostBlock nodes to hash of
	HostElement. The Host patterns is used as the key of the
	hash. This enables a better view of shh configuration in the GUI.

	* lib/Config/Model/OpenSsh.pm (assign): Store value in uniline
	leaf even with embedded white spaces.
	(write_all_host_block): adapted to Host structure change in model

2009-09-10  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.208

	* lib/Config/Model/models/**.pl: Changed 'level' of some elements
	to 'important' so the new wizard provided by C::M::TkUI will show
	the most imporant ssh and sshd configuration parameters.

2009-07-29  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.207

	* t/ssh_config.t: When run as root, skip the tests that must be
	run as regular user. (Fix Debian FTBS)

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Ssh/HostElement.pl: Fix model error:
	ServerAliveInterval is an integer, not a boolean

2009-06-24  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr> v1.206

	* Build.PL: added forgotten dependency on
	Parse::RecDescent. Depends on Config::Model 0.637

2009-06-23  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com>

	* lib/Config/Model/models/**.pl: replaced deprecated 'built_in'
	model parameter with 'upstream_default'. (In fact I just had to
	run "config-model-edit -model Ssh -save" (from
	Config::Model::Itself))

2009-04-11  Dominique Dumont  <domi.dumont@free.fr> v1.205

	* lib/Config/Model/OpenSsh.pm (read_ssh_file): fix bug that breaks
	with Config::Model 0.635

2009-03-09  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.204

	* t/ssh_config.t: Removed unused options that broke with
	Config::Model 0.634

	* config-edit-ssh: Update documentation

2009-02-03  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.203

	* t/augeas_*.t: Do the exec only if Augeas part can be tested. Use
	$^X in exec instead of 'perl'. This should also fix tests in CPAN.

2009-02-02  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.202

	* t/augeas*.t : Changed Augeas locale workaround to reduce the
	number of test failures in CPAN tests.

2009-01-29  Dominique Dumont  <dominique.dumont@hp.com> v1.201

	* config-edit-sshd: added workaround Augeas locale bug

	* Sshd files: Major bug fixes for Augeas integration

	* lib/Config/Model/OpenSsh.pm (read_ssh_file): Fix:  Host names 
	  are separated by white spaces and not comma

2008-11-16  Domi  <domi@bilbo.maison> 

	* lib/Config/Model/models/Sshd.pl: Added write through Augeas so
	comment in /etc/ssh/sshd_config can be preserved (requires Augeas and 
	Config::Model::Backend::Augeas)
	
	* config-edit-ssh: new command line to edit ~/.ssh/config file (as
	normal user) or /etc/ssh/ssh_config (as root)

2008-05-26  Dominique Dumont v0.104

	* all: changed module name from Sshd to OpenSsh

2008-05-24  Dominique Dumont v0.103
