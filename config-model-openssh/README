Config::Model::OpenSsh - OpenSsh graphical configuration editor

This module provides a graphical configuration editor for
/etc/ssh/sshd_config and (soon) /etc/ssh/ssh_config. 

Main dependencies:
- Config::Model::TkUI
- Config::Model

Suggested dependencies:
- Config::Model::CursesUI to get a curses interface for the editor

Once this module is installed, you can run (as root, but please backup
/etc/ssh/sshd_config before):

  # config-edit-sshd

You may want to try it safely first by writing the resulting sshd.conf
elsewhere (in this case you can run this command with your user
account):

  $ config-edit-sshd -write_conf_dir test 

If config-edit fails with your sshd.conf, you can try config-edit with
-force option.
