These sessions will try to reuse the master instance\'s network connection rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.

Setting this to ``ask\'\' will cause ssh to listen for control connections, but require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS program before they are accepted (see ssh-add(1) for details). If the ControlPath cannot be opened, ssh will continue without connecting to a master instance.

X11 and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the display and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is not pos sible to forward multiple displays or agents.

Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a master connection but fall back to creating a new one if
 one does not already exist. These options are: ``auto\'\' and ``autoask\'\'. The latter requires confirmation like the ``ask\'\' option.
