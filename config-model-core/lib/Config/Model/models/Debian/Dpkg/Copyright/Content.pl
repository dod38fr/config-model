The Copyright field collects all relevant copyright notices for the files of this paragraph. Not all copyright notices may apply to every individual file, and years of publication for one copyright holder may be gathered together. For example, if file A has:

      Copyright 2008 John Smith Copyright 2009 Angela Watts

      Copyright 2010 Angela Watts

the Copyright field for a stanza covering both file A and file B need contain only:

The Copyright field may contain the original copyright statement copied exactly (including the word \x{201c}Copyright\x{201d}), or it can shorten the text, as long as it does not sacrifice information. Examples in this specification use both forms.",
