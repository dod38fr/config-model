This directory contains a configuration model example for the
/etc/fstab file.

FstabModel.pm contains the configuration model (as explained in 
Config::Model(3pm) and Config::Model::Node(3pm).

fstab_test.pl will:
- read the fstab file 
- store the configuration information in the config tree constructed
  from the model.
- extract a report from the model
- print on STDOUT a minimal fstab file 
- print on STDOUT a fstab file with comments extracted from the help
  provided by the fstab model

The goal of this example is to be (relatively) easy to understand, not
to be complete.

Note that you need to compile the module (perl Makefile.PL && make) to
run the example, but you don't need to install the module.

Feel free to send me any modifications or enhancement of this example.
