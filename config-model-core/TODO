o [domi] Update compute so that a built-in value can also be computed. This
   is required to fix a bug is sshd_config where match element values
   are needlessly written to files


o [domi] Filter element according to element in SimpleUI and TERMUI

o [domi] Provide import/export of configuration data in free form XML

o [domi] Associate comment to configuration tree ?

o [domi] Add model plug-in facility
  Currently, models can be provided in modular load-on-demand
   classes. This is necessary if more applications are using
   config-model. But it's not the same mechanism as plug-in. Plugin is
   necessary for application like xorg which are delivered in modular
   packages.  

* A web interface. May be a Webmin integration
