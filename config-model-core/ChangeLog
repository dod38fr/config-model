2006-09-07  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.602

	* config-model: added -help and -man options to command line

	* Model.pm (load): model file now must return an array ref and not
	invoke Model methods. See t/big_model.pm for an example
	(load): can load model file for model class that contain '::'. In
	this case the model file is searched in a sub-directory just like
	a perl class (E.g Model::Foo -> Model/Foo.pm)

	* HashId.pm (create_default): can initialise children nodes while
	creating default keys. (Necessary to be able to write a
	configuration model for Xorg)

	* AnyId.pm (move): new method

2006-07-20  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.601

	* config-model: new program. This programs can be invoked to
	modify configuration files (provided the corresponding model is
	available in /etc/config-model.d). (Still shaky. Don't run as
	root)

2006-07-19  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com>

	* Node.pm (get_type): new method
	(get_cargo_type): new method
	(get_element_name): added type and cargo_type parameters to filter
	returned element depending on their type or cargo (contained) type
	(describe): new method. Uses new Describe.pm file

	* Value.pm (get_type): new method
	(get_cargo_type): new method

2006-07-18  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com>

	* Model.pm (load): new method. Model can load model declaration
	from /etc/config-model.d. The model must be valid perl script that
	ends with an array ref containing configuraiton class declaration
	like the one accepted by create_config_class

	* ListId.pm (get_type): new method

	* HashId.pm (get_type): new method

	* Exception.pm : Added WrongType exception for new grab parameters

	* AnyThing.pm (get_type): New method
	(grab): added strict, autoadd, type parameter.

	* AnyId.pm (get_cargo_type): new method.
	(config_class_name): new mehtod

	* Describe.pm: New file. Provides a human readable description of
	a configuration node.

2006-06-15  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.507

	* TermUI.pm: New file. Provides a shell like interactive user
	interface.

	* Node.pm: Now inherit AutoRead class

	* Instance.pm: Adapted for auto read/write.

2006-06-12  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> 

	* AutoRead.pm: New file. Provides node the capabilities to load
	config data when creating a configuration node.

2006-05-19  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.506

	* examples/fstab/FstabModel.pl: added Fstab example with its fstab
	configuration model. This example includes a small program that
	use this model to show some ways to extract configuration
	informations.

2006-05-17  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> 

	* Report.pm: new file. Provides report and audit facility for
	Node.pm

	* Node.pm (report): new method
	(audit): new method

	* Model.pm (create_config_class): added inheritance of
	configuration models.

	* HashId.pm (_get_all_indexes): sort returned indexes

	* Dumper.pm (dump_tree): fix list dump which did not work

	* AnyId.pm (fetch_all_values): new method

2006-04-21  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.505

	* WizardHelper.pm: New file. This class helps to create wizard
	widget for config models

	* Makefile.PL: ValueFormula is no longer compiled at build-time
	but on the fly at run-time. Hopefully this will fix Windows
	problem and ease integration downstream for a minor performance
	penalty at start time.

2006-04-10  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.504

	* Searcher.pm: Added search element feature. This feature provides
	a way to search for a configuration element in a configuration
	tree. The search can be launcher from an instance or any node of a
	configuration tree. Getting to searched target can be manual or
	automatic (with call-backs provided by user)

2006-03-21  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Changed grammar pre-compilation to add a "1;" at
	the end of ValueFormulaParser.pm (Makes Windows happy)

2006-03-16  Dominique Dumont  <domi@komarr.grenoble.hp.com> v0.503

	* Makefile.PL (MY::postamble): Corrected CPAN dependencies
