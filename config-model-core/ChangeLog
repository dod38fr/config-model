2008-03-18  Dominique Dumont  v0.620

	* TermUI.pm: Fixed to work with Term::ReadLine::Gnu or
	Term::ReadLine::Perl. Can also work in degraded mode without these
	2 modules. 
	The command handling part was moved to SimpleUI.pm

	* config-edit: added Simple UI mode so config-edit can be used
	with stdin and stdout

2008-02-29  Dominique Dumont  v0.619

	* Value.pm: removed kludgy enum_integer value type 

2008-02-27  Dominique Dumont  

	* Instance.pm (write_back): can override directory where config
	data is written back (necessary for GUI menu like "save in dir
	...")

2008-02-26  Dominique Dumont  

	* Node.pm (get_help): do not mangle description text (don't remove
	spurious \s and \n. Leave that to user)

2008-02-12  Dominique Dumont  v0.618

	* AnyThing.pm (composite_name): new method to return a name
	like element:index or element.

2008-02-08  Dominique Dumont  

	* CheckList.pm (): added refer_to and computed_refer_to accessors 

2008-01-28  Dominique Dumont v0.617

	development)

	* Exception.pm (): Fixed misleading error message for
	UnavailableElement exception

2008-01-25  Dominique Dumont  

	* Value.pm (): added "replace" parameter for enum Value. This
	enables to specify a substitution when storing value.

2008-01-23  Dominique Dumont  

	* WarpedNode.pm (check): no longer die when trying to retrieve
	warped out node, just return undef. This is necessary to be able
	to load configuration files with important error (e.g. a xorg.conf
	file with a wrong device driver: all driver option are no longer
	valid.)

	* Value.pm (check): Added doc for check.  

	* ObjTreeScanner.pm (permission): new method to get or set the
	permission of the scanner (after creation).

2007-12-04  Dominique Dumont  v0.616

	* AutoRead.pm (read_ini): added capability to read configuration
	data from ini file (See Config::Tiny)
	(write_ini): can use ini files to store configuration data
	(read_perl): added capability to read configuration data from a
	perl data structure (see Config::Model::DumpAsData) from a .pl
	(write_perl): can use perl file to store configuration data (.pl
	file)
	(auto_read_init): configuration model can specify cds (dump string
	see Config::Model::Dumper), perl or ini with 'read_config' and
	'write_config' parameter.

2007-11-15  Dominique Dumont  v0.615

	* config-edit: added '-force-load' option to load erroneous
	configuration data. bad data is discarded.

	* Value.pm : handle 'preset' mode to store values
	(fetch):accept mode parameter ( [ custom | preset |
	standard | default | non_built_in ] )

	* Loader.pm (_load_list): When loading list, empty value are
	considered as undef values. I.e 'list_a=a,,"",d' will
	load ('a',undef,'','d') to lista element

	* Instance.pm (new): added 'force_load' parameter to load
	erronueus configuration data. In this case, wrong data will be
	discarded.
	(preset_start): new. Use this method, then load configuration data
	that will be used as "preset data". You can use this feature to
	load data discovered by an automatic mechanism, like hardware
	scan.
	(preset_stop): new. Stop preset mode. Then all data entered will
	be considered as 'custom' data. These custom data can be compared
	to 'default' or 'preset' data for audit purpose
	(preset): new. Query if the instance is in 'preset' mode.

	* Dumper.pm (dump_tree): changed 'full_dump' parameter (0|1) to 
	'mode' (full | preset)
	(dump_tree): if a list contain undef values, they are dumped as
	a_list=a,b,,d. Empty values are dumped as a_list=a,b,"",d

	* CheckList.pm (store): work in preset mode
	(set_checked_list_as_hash): accept a mode parameter ([ custom |
	preset | standard | default ]) to be able to audit config data
	(fetch): idem

2007-10-19  Dominique Dumont v0.614

	* Value.pm: added 'uniline' value type for string with no embedded
	newline. (no "\n")

2007-10-11  Dominique Dumont

	* Model.pm (translate_id_names): new method to translate AnyId
	parameter changes

	* AnyId.pm: Changed some parameters: follow -> follow_keys,
	allow -> allow_keys, allow_from -> allow_keys_from

2007-10-09  Dominique Dumont

	* Model.pm (translate_id_default_info): provides backward
	compatibility for AnyId parameter changes.

	* AnyId.pm: default parameter is replaced by 'default_keys' and
	'default_with_init'.

2007-09-25  Dominique Dumont  v0.613

	* IdElementReference.pm: Changes the API of IdElementReference so
	that API is more explicit (Like the API change for
	ValueComputer). This change is backward compatible (model
	translation)

2007-09-20  Dominique Dumont  

	* ValueComputer.pm: Now compute paramater must use explicit
	parameters for compute formula, variables and replace.  Backward
	compatibility is kept by translating old compute declaration in
	Model.pm
	
2007-09-17  Dominique Dumont  

	* Model.pm (include_class): permission, level and description
	parameters can also be declared within the element declaration.
	(i.e. at the same level than 'type' )
	
	* IdElementReference.pm (): A reference to a list will now take
	into account the values of the list instead of the indexes of the
	list. This makes more sense...

	* CheckList.pm: Change the name of 'default' parameter to
         'default_list' ('default' is still accepted but is deprecated)

2007-09-06  Dominique Dumont  

	* WarpedNode.pm: improved synopsis in doc
	(load_data): new method (forgotten in 0.612)

	* Model.pm: -doc: added synopsis
	- inherit is deprecated in favor of include 
	- inherit_after is deprecated in favor of include_after
	- Raise an exception if an element is declared twice in a
	  model (even through include mechanism: overriding an
	  included element leads to confusion)

2007-07-26  Dominique Dumont  v0.612

	* HashId.pm : can preserve hash key order (when created with
	ordered => 1). New method to manipulate hash key order are swap,
	move_up, move_down.

	* Exception.pm :new error class  Config::Model::Exception::LoadData

	* AnyThing.pm (grab): added 'grab_non_available' parameter.

	* AnyId.pm: added "ordered" parameter to create ordered hash
	elements. I.e. hashes where the order of the keys is kept (like
	Tie::IxHash)

2007-07-18  Dominique Dumont  

	* Value.pm (load_data): new method

	* Node.pm (load_data): new method
	(dump_as_data): new method 

	* Model.pm (inherit_class): added inherit_after parameter. In a
	model, the order of the elements is important. This parameter
	enable a model to inherit elements from another class and to place
	them in a specific place among the original elements.
	(load): returns the names of the class loaded by this method.

	* ListId.pm (load_data): new method

	* HashId.pm (load_data): new method

	* CheckList.pm (load_data): new method

2007-07-03  Dominique Dumont  v0.611

	* WarpedThing.pm: Modified the way to specify complex warped
	rules. The former way based on list of lists was confusing. Now
	you can specify boolean expressions to find the warp rule to apply.
	
	* Model.pm: Simplified config class inheritance mechanism: inherit
	all or nothing. Added translation of legacy warp parameter (based
	on list of lists) to new warp parameters (based on boolean
	expressions). So the change done in WarpedThing is backward
	compatible.
	
2007-06-06  Dominique Dumont v0.610

	* Model.pm (inherit_class): Fix configuration class inheritance
	mechanism

2007-06-04  Dominique Dumont  

	* Value.pm: can also warp help for enum value

2007-05-09  Dominique Dumont   v0.609

	* config-edit: renamed from config-model

2007-05-07  Dominique Dumont  

	* examples/fstab/fstab_test.pl (produce_fstab): added curses
	interface example (need to install Config::Model::CursesUI to
	work)

2007-05-04  Dominique Dumont  

	* config-model: added possibility to use the curses interface
	provided by Config::Model::CursesUI (if this one is installed)

	* ValueComputer.pm: Modified so compute may return an undef value
	if one of the variable (extracted from the configuration data) of
	the formula is undefined. In other word, propagate undef instead
	of croaking.

	* Searcher.pm: Lots of bug fixes
	(get_searchable_elements): new method
	(prepare): new method. Search is now done in 3 moves: create the
	searcher object, prepare the search, and run the search

	* Value.pm: removed unique_value parameter which was a bad idea
	for a check list implementation. Moved reference handling into new
	IdElementReference class

	* IdElementReference.pm: New class extracted from Value object so
	reference can be used also by CheckList

	* CheckList.pm: re-wrote as a "check_list" type and not a "list"
	type

2007-04-27  Dominique Dumont  

	* Instance.pm (reset_config): new method
	(searcher): renamed search_element to
	searcher. searcher retunrs a Config::Model::Searcher object.

	searcher. searcher retunrs a Config::Model::Searcher object.

	* AnyId.pm (copy): new method to deep-copy the content of a hash
	or id element.

2007-04-13  Dominique Dumont  

	* Value.pm: moved out reference facility in
	Config::Model::IdElementReference

2007-03-16  Dominique Dumont

2007-01-11  Dominique Dumont  v0.606

	* config-model: Corrected wrong doc for options.

	* Describe.pm: Small cosmetic changes in output.

2007-01-08  Dominique Dumont  v0.605

	* config-model: Now uses Log::Log4perl. (Still need to use
	Log4perl for all *.pm files though). Now write config files back.
	Added option to read and write config in test directories.

	* *.pm: Changed e-mail address to reduce spam.

	* *.pm: Small bug and doc fixes.
	
2006-12-08  Dominique Dumont 

	* Model.pm (load): Model files are expected to be delivered as
	Perl module and are searched using @INC. (E.g. Xorg.pl model will
	be searched as Config/Model/models/Xorg.pl in @INC elements)

	* Exception.pm (full_message): Clarified error message of
	RestrictedElement exception

	* examples/fstab/fstab_test.pl: Clarified notifications shown to
	user. Adapted to changes of 0.604

2006-12-06  Dominique Dumont   v0.604

	must be set to 'reference' when using 'refer_to' parameter.

	* WarpedThing.pm: can group rules declaration in warp argument to
	save typing

	* WizardHelper.pm: adapted for ObjTreeScanner changes

2006-12-05  Dominique Dumont

	- improved doc
	- added callback example in doc

	* AutoRead.pm (auto_write_init): bug fix in auto_write functions

	* AnyId.pm (new): New allow and allow_from parameters to set
	"allowed" keys of a hash or list. This list of allowed keys can be
	fixed or dynamic.

	* AnyThing.pm (root): new method. Returns the root node of the
	configuration tree.
	(grab): bug fix so hash identifier can contain white spaces when
	calling grab (e.g. InputDevice:"Configured Mouse")

	index can contain white space. (e.g. Monitor:"Hercules Pro")

	* AnyId.pm: changed 'element_args' to 'cargo_args'. Changed
	'element_class' to 'cargo_class'. Added 'follow' parameter so a
	hash key can mimic the keys of another hash in the configuration
	tree.

	* TermUI.pm: removed debug print. This makes auto-completion much
	easier to understand ;-)

2006-09-26  Dominique Dumont  

	* Value.pm (set_default): added built_in default
	parameter. Built_in default parameter are not written in
	configuration files but can be used to audit configuration data.
	
	* AutoRead.pm (auto_read_init): bug fix: override of read_dir was
	not taken into account
	(auto_write_init): idem for write_dir

2006-09-22  Dominique Dumont

	* config-model: added -help and -man options to command line

	* Model.pm (load): model file now must return an array ref and not
	invoke Model methods. See t/big_model.pm for an example

	this case the model file is searched in a sub-directory just like
	a perl class (E.g Model::Foo -> Model/Foo.pm)

	creating default keys. (Necessary to be able to write a
	configuration model for Xorg)

	* AnyId.pm (move): new method

2006-07-20  Dominique Dumont   v0.601

	* config-model: new program. This programs can be invoked to
	modify configuration files (provided the corresponding model is
	available in /etc/config-model.d). (Still shaky. Don't run as
	root)

2006-07-19  Dominique Dumont  

	* Node.pm (get_type): new method
	(get_cargo_type): new method
	(get_element_name): added type and cargo_type parameters to filter
	returned element depending on their type or cargo (contained) type

	* Value.pm (get_type): new method
	(get_cargo_type): new method

2006-07-18  Dominique Dumont  

	* Model.pm (load): new method. Model can load model declaration
	from /etc/config-model.d. The model must be valid perl script that
	ends with an array ref containing configuraiton class declaration
	like the one accepted by create_config_class

	* ListId.pm (get_type): new method

	* HashId.pm (get_type): new method

	config data when creating a configuration node.

2006-05-19  Dominique Dumont   v0.506

	* examples/fstab/FstabModel.pl: added Fstab example with its fstab
	configuration model. This example includes a small program that
	use this model to show some ways to extract configuration
	informations.

2006-05-17  Dominique Dumont

2006-04-21  Dominique Dumont   v0.505

	* WizardHelper.pm: New file. This class helps to create wizard
	widget for config models

	* Makefile.PL: ValueFormula is no longer compiled at build-time
	but on the fly at run-time. Hopefully this will fix Windows
	problem and ease integration downstream for a minor performance
	penalty at start time.

2006-04-10  Dominique Dumont   v0.504

	* Searcher.pm: Added search element feature. This feature provides
	a way to search for a configuration element in a configuration
	tree. The search can be launcher from an instance or any node of a
	configuration tree. Getting to searched target can be manual or
	automatic (with call-backs provided by user)

2006-03-21  Dominique Dumont
