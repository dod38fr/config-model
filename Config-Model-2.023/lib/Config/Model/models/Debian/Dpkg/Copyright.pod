=head1 NAME

Config::Model::models::Debian::Dpkg::Copyright - Configuration class Debian::Dpkg::Copyright

=head1 VERSION

version 2.023

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration classes used by L<Config::Model>

Machine-readable debian/copyright. Parameters from former version 
of DEP-5 are flagged as deprecated. The idea is to enable migration from older 
specs to CANDIDATE spec.

To edit a copyright file, go into your package development directory and run:

  config-edit -application dpkg-copyright
   
To check you file run:

  config-edit -application dpkg-copyright -ui none
    
To upgrade your file from an old spec, run:

  config-edit -application dpkg-copyright -ui none -save


=head1 Elements

=head2 Format

URI of the format specification.I<< Mandatory. Type uniline. default: 'http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/'.  >>

=head2 Upstream-Name

=head2 Upstream-Contact

Note: Upstream-Contact values are migrated from '- Upstream-Maintainer'

=head2 Source

An explanation from where the upstream source came from. Typically this would be a URL, but it might be a free-form explanation. The Debian Policy, 12.5 requires this information unless there are no upstream sources, which is mainly the case for native Debian packages. If the upstream source has been modified to remove non-free parts, that should be explained in this field.I<< Optional. Type string.  >>

Note: Source is migrated with 

 $old || $older ;

and with $older => "C<- Original-Source-Location>", $old => "C<- Upstream-Source>"

=head2 Comment

This field can provide additional information. For example, it might quote an e-mail from upstream justifying why the license is acceptable to the main archive, or an explanation of how this version of the package has been forked from a version known to be DFSG-free, even though the current upstream version is not.I<< Optional. Type string.  >>

Note: Comment is migrated with 'C<$old>' and with $old => "C<- X-Comment>"
