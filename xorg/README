Config::Model::Xorg - Xorg configuration tool based on Config::Model

This module provides a Xorg configuration model. 

With this module and Config::Model, you have a tool to tune the
configuration of your favourite X server.

Installing Config::Model::TkUI is recommended as you'll have a
more user friendly curses based user interface.

(You may also want to install Config::Model::CursesUI to get a curses
interface in case Xorg server is down)

Once this module is installed, you can run (as root, but please backup
/etc/X11/xorg.conf before):

  # config-edit -model Xorg

You may want to try it safely first by writing the resulting xorg.conf
elsewhere (in this case you can run this command with your user
account):

  $ config-edit -model Xorg -write_directory test 

If config-edit fails with your xorg.conf (See BUGS section below), you
can try config-edit with -force option.

Note that you must run this command where you unpacked
this perl module:

  $ config-edit -model Xorg -read data -write wr_test

If you do not have the curses user interface, be sure to read doc
which explain the basic command of the terminal based interface:

MODULE CONTENT

This Perl modules contains several files (listed in MANIFEST). Here
are the purpose of the main files:
- Build.PL : script to build the Perl module. See Module::Build(3pm)
- data/xorg.conf: sample xorg.conf used with non-reg test
- lib/Config/Model/models : directory containing Xorg model files. The
  main model is Xorg.pl. The complete xorg model is made from all
  files contained in this directory.
- lib/Config/Model/Xorg/Read.pm: Read xorg.conf files
- lib/Config/Model/Xorg/Write.pm: Write xorg.conf files
- t/xorg.t: non-regression test

--------------------------------------------------------------------

KEYBOARD MODEL

If Xorg is installed on your system, the keyboard model will be
generated by Build.PL from the content of the lst files in your
xkb/rules directory.

If Xorg is not installed, this module will fallback on a keyboard
model created on a Debian GNU/Linux system. (This is done so that CPAN
testers can be run even on servers without Xorg).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS

This model is quite young and is incomplete.

So far, the following video cards have a model (see
lib/Config/Model/models/Xorg/Device/ directory) :
- ATI card (rather complete Radeon.pl model for radeon driver and Fglrx model)
- Nvidia card (very preliminary Nvidia.pl model for Nvidia proprietary
  driver)
