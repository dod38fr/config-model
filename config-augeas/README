Config-Augeas
=============

Augeas is a library that focuses on the most basic problem in handling
Linux configurations programmatically: editing actual configuration
files in a controlled manner.

To that end, Augeas exposes a tree of all configuration settings
(well, all the ones it knows about) and a simple local API for
manipulating the tree. Augeas then modifies underlying configuration
files according to the changes that have been made to the tree; it
does as little modeling of configurations as possible, and focuses
exclusively on transforming the tree-oriented syntax of its public API
to the myriad syntaxes of individual configuration files.

This module provides an object oriented Perl interface for Augeas
configuration edition library with a more "perlish" API than Augeas C
counterpart.
