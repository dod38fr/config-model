Config::Model::TkUi - Tk GUI to edit config data through Config::Model

This module provides a Perl/Tk interface to:
- the configuration editor provided by Config::Model.
- the configuration model editor provided by Config::Model::Itself

For instance, with this module, Config::Model and
Config::Model::OpenSsh, you get a graphical configuration editor for
sshd_config.

This projects also needs help to improve its user interfaces:
- Look and feel of Perl/Tk interface can be improved
- A nice logo (a penguin with a wrench maybe ) would be welcomed
- Config::Model could use a web interface
- May be also an interface based on Gtk or Wx for better integration
  in Desktop
