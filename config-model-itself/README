Config::Model::Itself - Config::Model model (for Config::Model)

This module provides a configuration model for Config::Model.

Which means that you can use the same UI to edit configuration data
(for instance Xorg configuration data from xorg.conf) and Xorg model
(if you need to add new parameters in Xorg model)

With this module and Config::Model, you have a tool to tune the
configuration models.

Installing Config::Model::CursesUI is recommended as you'll have a
more user friendly curses based user interface.

-- TO BE MODIFIED BELOW

Once this module is installed, you can run (as root, but please backup
/etc/X11/xorg.conf before):

  # config-edit -model Xorg

You may want to try it safely first by writing the resulting xorg.conf
elsewhere (in this case you can run this command with your user
account):

  $ config-edit -model Xorg -write_directory test 

If config-edit fails with your xorg.conf (See BUGS section below), you
can try config-edit with the provided xorg.conf (but it won't be
useful for you as this file will not match your hardware
configuration). Note that you must run this command where you unpacked
this perl module:

  $ config-edit -model Xorg -read data -write wr_test

If you do not have the curses user interface, be sure to read doc
which explain the basic command of the terminal based interface:

MODULE CONTENT

This Perl modules contains several files (listed in MANIFEST). Here
are the purpose of the main files:
- Build.PL : script to build the Perl module. See Module::Build(3pm)
- data/xorg.conf: sample xorg.conf used with non-reg test
- lib/Config/Model/models : directory containing Xorg model files. The
  main model is Xorg.pl. The complete xorg model is made from all
  files contained in this directory.
- lib/Config/Model/Xorg/Read.pm: Read xorg.conf files
- lib/Config/Model/Xorg/Write.pm: Write xorg.conf files
- t/xorg.t: non-regression test

--------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS

This model is quite young and is incomplete.

So far, the following video cards have a model (see
lib/Config/Model/models/Xorg/Device/ directory) :
- ATI card (rather complete Radeon.pl model for radeon driver)
- Nvidia card (very preliminary Nvidia.pl model for Nvidia proprietary
  driver)
