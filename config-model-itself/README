Config::Model::Itself - Config::Model model (for Config::Model)

This module provides a model of Config:Model (hence the Itself name).

Let's step back a little to explain. Any configuration data is, in
essence, structured data. This data could be stored in an XML file. A
configuration model is a way to describe the structure and relation of
all items of a configuration data set.

This configuration model is also expressed as structured data. This
structure data is structured and follow a set of rules which are
described for humans in Config::Model.

The structure and rules documented in Config::Model are also expressed
in a model in the files provided with Config::Model::Itself.

Hence the possibity to verify, modify configuration data provided by
Config::Model can also be applied on configuration models. Using the
same user interface.

The model editor program is config-model-edit.

If you install Config::Model::TkUI, you will have a GUI. Likewise, if
you install also Config::Model::CursesUI, you can choose a curse
interface.

Which means that you can use the same UI to edit configuration data
(for instance Xorg configuration data from xorg.conf) and Xorg model
(if you need to add new parameters in Xorg model)

-- TO BE MODIFIED BELOW

Once this module is installed, you can run (as root, but please backup
/etc/X11/xorg.conf before):

  # config-model-edit -model <model_name>

For instance, if you have installed Config::Model::Xorg, you can run

  # config-model-edit -model Xorg
