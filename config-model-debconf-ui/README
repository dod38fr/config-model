Config::Model::TkUi - Tk GUI to edit config data through Config::Model

This module provides a Perl/Tk interface to:
- the configuration editor provided by Config::Model.
- the configuration model editor provided by Config::Model::Itself

For instance, with this module, Config::Model and
Config::Model::OpenSsh, you get a graphical configuration editor for
sshd_config.
